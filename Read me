Cloning a project from GitHub means you're downloading the code repository to your local machine using Git. This is typically done with:

git clone https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox.git
When you clone a Docker Compose project from GitHub, youâ€™re getting:

The docker-compose.yml file

Application source code

Environment files (.env)

Dockerfiles (if needed for building custom images)

ðŸ”„ How It All Works Together
You clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox.git
cd docker-compose-project
You review or modify the docker-compose.yml file.

You start the services:

docker-compose up
Docker Compose reads the file and spins up all defined servicesâ€”like a web server, database, Redis cache, etc.â€”as containers on your system.
